# finalProject

In this project, I put together a mobile application meant to show statistics of CoVID-19 cases on a per-country basis. This application is meant to have a login and signup screen, as well as an option to save a country for later as a favorite. The data regarding the countries is to be shown as a chart. The way I was able to render these charts was with CanvasJS. Thanks to CanvasJS, the data seamlessly turned into bar graphs regardless of requests. There were no API keys required as the API used was Novel-CoVID.

Development Tools Used:
